Based on [Fabric Carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet) by [gnembon](https://github.com/gnembon)

Carpet Mod is a mod for vanilla Minecraft that allows you to take full control of what matters from a technical perspective of the game.

## Modding RiftedCarpet

To help develop this mod:

Half of the libs are down, and the ones that are up and working doesn't look stable at all, for that reason I decided to
load them from a local directory. I'm not allowed to distribute those libs, if you want to help to develop this mod you
can find me on discord `Kahzerx#0733`.

~~Open the project with eclipse/idea and on `External libraries` -> `start` -> `net.minecraftforge.gradle` -> and run `GradleStart`.~~

~~Set `--tweakClass org.dimdev.riftloader.launch.RiftLoaderClientTweaker` as program arguments.~~

~~Java `1.8` and `classpath module` -> `RiftedCarpet.main`.~~
